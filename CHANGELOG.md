# Changelog

## task-orchestrator 0.5.0
- Session workers (`TASK-0201`, `ADR-0050`): `dispatch` takes `runAs: "session"` for a task the person asks to run as a session. The mod answers with the `start_session` call to make, adopts that call into the task by its assignment header, reads the session id from the result, and collects through `get_session` and `list_events`. A session worker takes its own worktree, has no write fence, and starts only on a turn the person started.
- `ADR-0041` clause 5 is narrowed by `ADR-0050`; subagents are unchanged.
- Seen in a spike only (2026-11-03): the hook saw `start_session` and its result, and `get_session` confirmed a Sonnet 5.5 child's requested model and effort. Not yet run live: the adoption itself, two session workers side by side, auto mode.
- The effort warning follows what ran: `dispatch` no longer says a host `modelSettings` effort "may replace" the request; a worker whose observed effort differs from its requested one carries `effort mismatch: requested X, observed Y`, naming the host setting if one is set, in `status` and `collect`. Seen 2026-11-03: three workers ran at their requested effort under `modelSettings.claude-sonnet-5-5.effortLevel = xhigh`.
- A session task waiting for the person's turn holds no worker slot.

## 0.1.0
- Scaffolded harmonized structure (component layer + .ai governance layer).
